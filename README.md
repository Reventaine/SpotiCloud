# SpotiCloud

SpotCloud is a tool that gives you insight into the emotional tone of your favorite Spotify playlists.<br>
With this project, you can analyze the lyrics of all the songs in a playlist and get a sentiment analysis score for a playlist.<br>
This score indicates whether the lyrics of the song are generally positive or negative.<br>
You can also visualize the most frequently used words in the lyrics with a word cloud.<br>
The word cloud provides a visual representation of the words that are used the most in the playlist,
allowing you to get a quick overview of the common themes in the lyrics.<br> 
Whether you're a music lover or a data enthusiast, SpotCloud is a fun and easy way to dive into the emotional
content of your playlists.<br>
