## SpotiCloud

SpotCloud is a tool that gives you insight into the emotional tone of your favorite Spotify playlists.
With this project, you can analyze the lyrics of all the songs in a playlist and get a sentiment analysis score for a playlist.
This score indicates whether the lyrics of the song are generally positive or negative.
You can also visualize the most frequently used words in the lyrics with a word cloud.
The word cloud provides a visual representation of the words that are used the most in the playlist,
allowing you to get a quick overview of the common themes in the lyrics. 
Whether you're a music lover or a data enthusiast, SpotCloud is a fun and easy way to dive into the emotional
content of your playlists.
